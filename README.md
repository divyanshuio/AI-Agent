# AI Agent

## how to use:
So for our purposes I have hardcoded the wroking directory to be ./calculator and when you type,<br>
```python3 main.py "add another operation in the calculator.py so that it can also calculate remainder using % operator"```<br>
it will perform those actions using the functions I have made in the functions directory.

## How to run on your machine
make a google ai studio accound and create a free API key
download or clone the repo on your machine and create a <b>.env</b> file put this inside it</br>

```GEMINI_API_KEY="Your API Key"```<br>

Though it is very basic right now I do plan to improve it more.
