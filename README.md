#AI Agent

##how to use:
So for our purposes I have hardcoded the wroking directory to be ./calculator and when you type,
```python3 main.py "add another operation in the calculator.py so that it can also calculate remainder using % operator"```
it will perform those actions using the functions I have made in the functions directory.

##How to run on your machine
make a google ai studio accound and create a free API key
download or clone the repo on your machine and create a **.env** file put this inside it
```GEMINI_API_KEY=\Your API Key\```

Though it is very basic right now I do plan to improve it more.
